          <h2>What is a sandwich?</h2>
          <p>A sandwich, according to the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sandwich">Merriam-Webster dictionary</a>, is defined as <q>two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between.</q> In general terms, that means meat, vegetables and other food items between 2 pieces of bread, either cut apart or connected like with a subway sandwich.</p>
          <h2>When sandwich?</h2>
          <p>The use of bread or similar substances as a cover or scoop for other food long predates modern history and was seen in a variety of civilizations across the globe. However, the modern sandwich can arguably be traced back to the 18th century with John Montagu, Earl of Sandwich. He was quite fond of eating salt beef between two pieces of bread while gambling as it allowed him to eat with one hand, without utensils, and without dirtying his fingers.</p>
          <h2>Why sandwich?</h2>
          <p>Depending on the filling used, sandwiches can be both healthy and filling as well as easy to make, pack away, and eat without any necessary tools. This makes it a convenient choice for lunch or as a snack when you don't want to buy or make food, especally if you're away from home or far away from accessible food sources.</p>

          <h2>Setting up your sandwich making zone</h2>
          <p>You will ideally have a table or other preparation surface at waist to chest height and at least about an arms length in width and length. You should clear your preparation zone of unnecessary objects and clean the surface with soap and water to prevent contamination. Place a dish or paper towel onto your preparation zone to place your sandwiches upon. Finally, gather any necessary tools such as a knife to cut your ingredients or a butter knife or spoon to spread any dressings.</p>
          <h2>Your choice of ingredients</h2>
          <p>Sandwiches can be filled with any number and type of ingredients! But as stated in the definition above, you must have a piece or 2 of bread to put your filling between. Your bread can be sliced into two or split in half with a connection on one end. The ingredients used are dependent on availability and influenced by your culture, region and personal tastes. Some potential ingredients are listed below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Breads: wheat, baguette, bagel, etc.</li>
              <li>Meats: ham, beef, turkey, etc.</li>
              <li>Cheese: American, cheddar, pepperjack etc.</li>
              <li>Vegetables: tomato, lettuce, cucumber, etc.</li>
              <li>Dressings: ranch, mayonnaise, honey mustard, etc.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Sandwich making made easy</h2>
          <p>Begin by taking your bread and opening it up. Spread whatever dressings you'd like directly onto the bread. Next, you can add your ingredients to the sandwich in any order, but I prefer to place the vegetables first, then the meat so that it holds the vegetables in place with its weight. Then I like to add my cheese on top of the meat, and finally top it off with the the remaining piece of bread. Voila! A simple sandwich made simply, but full of a variety of essential dietary nutrients.</p>

          <h2>Sprucing up your sandwich</h2>
          <p>Think your sandwich is a little too simple? Doll it up using a variety of techniques to give it a little more oomph. You can use a knife to diagonally cut your sandwich in half or into four pieces. You can also pin your sandwich using a toothpick to help hold it together while also adding a little flair. You can even add an olive or anything similar on top of the toothpick.</p>
          <h2>Packing up your sandwich</h2>
          <p>One of the many brilliances of the sandwich is its ability to easily be brought and eaten anywhere! You can simply put your sandwich into a ziploc bag or wrap it up securely in a paper towel. Your sandwich will last several hours at room temperature, but you can also put it in a fridge or if you don't have one, a temperature insulated bag or container to make sure it stays fresh.<p>

          <h2>Easy cleaning</h2>
          <p>You barely need to spend any time on cleanup! If you used a knife to cut the bread or another tool to spread your dressings, all you need to do is rinse it off. After that, you just need to put away all your ingredients and wipe off the surface of your preparation zone. It's as easy as that!</p>
          <h2>Tasty cleaning</h2>
          <p>Ultimately, the very last thing you need to do is clean up your sandwich itself. Thankfully, the ingenuity of the sandwich lends itself to doing that easily. As mentioned before, the sandwich is easy to consume and makes little mess other than a few pesky crumbs. Simply hold your sandwich with one or both hands and take a bite out of your sandwich. Let its delightfulness dance upon your tongue and notice how your fingers do not get greasy as the bread itself acts as a shield against the unclean world. After the majesty of your sandwich has passed, you may be feeling empty inside your heart, but not in your stomach! Be at ease, it's very easy to make another sandwich.
